# Table

It's a collection of `@tanstack/table-core` adapters for frameworks other than `React`. Currently, it only has a `Solid` adapter published as `@izznatsir/table-solid`. In the future, these adapter packages might be transferred to `TanStack` organization.

It also contains `@izznatsir/table-core` package which is extracted from my PR in `react-table` repository to work well with multiple frameworks. When that PR is merged, the package will we be removed.
