# Example: Solid Column Pinning

All examples are included as workspaces. Run these commands in the project root directory, not in the example directory:

-   `yarn workspace @examples/solid-column-pinning dev`

Lazy? [Run it on StacBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/izznatsir/table/tree/main/examples/solid/column-pinning).
